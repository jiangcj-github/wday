    "由于Segwit2X宣告失败，海外Evey团队和007团队联合开发的Bitcoin Diamond（比特币钻石）应运而生！    比特币钻石币背后有一个非常有趣的想法，因为有一小部分比特币核心开发商认为比特币创建是不可改变的，比特币作为分散货币创建的主要目的是为了给大众控制和管理自己的钱和通过自己的家用电脑的权力。这正是比特币钻石在比特币挖掘中重新赋予普通人的权利，从而实现真正的分权。通过采用新的工作证明挖掘算法来解决这个问题，该算法将再次使人们能够在家用电脑上挖掘比特币金币。比特币钻石,预计在十一月十八日       比特币钻石由Bitcoin Diamond Foundation负责全球运营，属比特币区块的新分叉币，英文缩写BCD，将于比特币区块高度495866分叉，在预定的区块高度下，比特币钻石矿工将使用新的工作验证算法开始创建区块，并将陆续在BTC原有特性上增加转账隐私保护等功能。原始的比特币区块链保持不变，比特币钻石是其一个新的硬分叉链。需要比特币交易平台系统开发关注VxinQKL17999新的分支与Bitcoin有相同的交易历史，直到分叉产生新链，这条新的BTC分叉链称为比特币钻石。比特币钻石在快速发展中的解决比特币的一系列问题1.隐私保护：BCD添加转账金额加密功能，从而保护参与者的交易隐私，使整个交易生态更安全更具备隐私性。2.提高交易速度：BCD提高单位区块大小并支持每个区块大小为一个动态值，更灵活地处理每个区块中的所有交易。除此之外，将出块速度提高了5倍，最终目的是为了提高整个链中的交易确认速度。3.降低转账手续费和用户参与门槛：BCD总量为BTC的10倍，降低了用户的单位参与成本与门槛，使得更多的用户能更容易地参与到BCD的交易活动当中。     但现在，比特币的网络大部分都是由强大的中国矿工提供的，这些矿工雇用专用硬件ASIC来挖掘新的比特币。所以他们对比特币的网络有更大的影响。然而，Segwit2x支持者指出，大约90％的矿工正在通过硬分叉来发信号通知协议升级，百度交易系统开发贺顾问。未来几个月我们可以看到比特币的短期波动，但长期看来非常乐观。货币的未来是数字化的，这是毫无疑问的。正可谓是：真正的比特币，价值就像钻石一样稀少。":

This new BTC branching chain is called Bitcoin Diamond. Bitcoin Diamonds' rapid development of a series of issues to solve Bitcoin 1. Privacy Protection: BCD adds the transfer amount encryption function to protect the privacy of participants' transactions, making the entire transaction ecosystem safer and more private. 2. Increase transaction speed: BCD increases the size of unit blocks and supports each block size as a dynamic value, allowing more flexible handling of all transactions in each block. In addition, the block speed is increased by a factor of five. The ultimate goal is to increase the speed of transaction confirmation in the entire chain. 3. Reduce the transfer fee and user participation threshold: The total amount of BCD is 10 times that of BTC, which reduces the user's unit participation cost and threshold, so that more users can more easily participate in the BCD trading activities. But now, most of Bitcoin's network is provided by powerful Chinese miners who employ dedicated hardware ASICs to mine new bitcoins. So they have a greater impact on Bitcoin's network. However, Segwit2x supporters pointed out that about 90% of the miners are signaling a protocol upgrade through hard fork, and Baidu’s trading system development consultant.

    "Asch是一个去中心化的应用平台，其设计初衷是为了降低开发者的门槛，比如使用javascript作为应用编程语言，支持关系数据库来存储交易数据，使得开发一个dapp与传统的web应用非常相似，相信这对开发者和中小型企业有很大的吸引力，只有开发者的生产力提高了，整个平台的生态才能够更迅速的繁荣起来。Asch在设计上也是开放的，并没有局限于某个细分领域，比如金融、文件存储、版权证明等，其提供的api都是较底层和抽象的，它们可以被自由组合实现各种不同的应用。在共识机制方面，Asch继承并增强了DPOS算法，大大降低了分叉几率和双重支付风险。另外，Asch的侧链即应用模式不但延缓了区块链膨胀问题，还使得dapp更加的灵活和个性化。Asch是一个具有前瞻性的、低成本的一站式应用解决方案，相信将成为新一代去中心化应用的孵化器。":
      "Asch is an efficient, flexible and safe decentralized application platform, which was initially designed to lower the threshold / barrier to entry for developers. With the use of JavaScript as its application programming language, the platform makes use of relational databases to store data, drawing similarities between developing a DAPP and developing a traditional web application. This type of platform carries a great deal of appeal to developers, as well as small and medium enterprises, since its ease of use results in greater productivity, fueling and facilitating a more prosperous ecosystem in the process. Asch is open in design and is not limited to any particular niche market such as finance, document storage, copyright certification, etc. The APIs which it provides are underlying and abstract, and they can be combined freely so as to facilitate a variety of applications. In terms of the consensus mechanism, Asch has inherited and enhanced the DPOS algorithm, simultaneously reducing the probability of forking and double spending by a significant degree. Furthermore, Asch's side chain, i.e. the application mode, not only improves scalability by delaying the expansion of the blockchain, but also makes DAPPs more flexible and personalized. Asch is a forward-looking, low-cost and one-stop application solution, which is believed to be a new generation of incubator for decentralized application.",
